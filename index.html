      <p> My Favorite Hobby is Drawing. whenever I get free time I go to my room and take out my drawing file and start drawing. I like to experiment with colors. I have completed many mediums like, when I was in first stage I used to do crayons, then I moved on to oil pastels, and now I am on soft pastels(my favorite medium),then I will do Charcoal Pencils.
        In between I have been to many summer camps with my ma'am. My home is full of paintings, for example for Diwali I was working on 2 canvas(very big canvas).Nowadays, I have started doing calligraphy. It's very intresting!
